/**
 * This class is used to create operating system processes.
 *
 * <p>Each {@code ProcessBuilderForWindows} instance manages a collection
 * of process attributes.  The {@link #start()} method creates a new
 * {@link Process} instance with those attributes.  The {@link
 * #start()} method can be invoked repeatedly from the same instance
 * to create new subprocesses with identical or related attributes.
 *
 * <p>Each process builder manages these process attributes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>a <i>command</i>, a list of strings which signifies the
 * external program file to be invoked and its arguments, if any.
 * Which string lists represent a valid operating system command is
 * system-dependent.  For example, it is common for each conceptual
 * argument to be an element in this list, but there are operating
 * systems where programs are expected to tokenize command line
 * strings themselves - on such a system a Java implementation might
 * require commands to contain exactly two elements.
 *
 * <li>an <i>environment</i>, which is a system-dependent mapping from
 * <i>variables</i> to <i>values</i>.  The initial value is a copy of
 * the environment of the current process (see {@link System#getenv()}).
 *
 * <li>a <i>working directory</i>.  The default value is the current
 * working directory of the current process, usually the directory
 * named by the system property {@code user.dir}.
 *
 * <li><a name="redirect-input">a source of <i>standard input</i></a>.
 * By default, the subprocess reads input from a pipe.  Java code
 * can access this pipe via the output stream returned by
 * {@link Process#getOutputStream()}.  However, standard input may
 * be redirected to another source using
 * {@link #redirectInput(ProcessBuilderForWin32.Redirect) redirectInput}.
 * In this case, {@link Process#getOutputStream()} will return a
 * <i>null output stream</i>, for which:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>the {@link OutputStream#write(int) write} methods always
 * throw {@code IOException}
 * <li>the {@link OutputStream#close() close} method does nothing
 * </ul>
 *
 * <li><a name="redirect-output">a destination for <i>standard output</i>
 * and <i>standard error</i></a>.  By default, the subprocess writes standard
 * output and standard error to pipes.  Java code can access these pipes
 * via the input streams returned by {@link Process#getInputStream()} and
 * {@link Process#getErrorStream()}.  However, standard output and
 * standard error may be redirected to other destinations using
 * {@link #redirectOutput(ProcessBuilderForWin32.Redirect) redirectOutput} and
 * {@link #redirectError(ProcessBuilderForWin32.Redirect) redirectError}.
 * In this case, {@link Process#getInputStream()} and/or
 * {@link Process#getErrorStream()} will return a <i>null input
 * stream</i>, for which:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>the {@link InputStream#read() read} methods always return
 * {@code -1}
 * <li>the {@link InputStream#available() available} method always returns
 * {@code 0}
 * <li>the {@link InputStream#close() close} method does nothing
 * </ul>
 *
 * <li>a <i>redirectErrorStream</i> property.  Initially, this property
 * is {@code false}, meaning that the standard output and error
 * output of a subprocess are sent to two separate streams, which can
 * be accessed using the {@link Process#getInputStream()} and {@link
 * Process#getErrorStream()} methods.
 *
 * <p>If the value is set to {@code true}, then:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>standard error is merged with the standard output and always sent
 * to the same destination (this makes it easier to correlate error
 * messages with the corresponding output)
 * <li>the common destination of standard error and standard output can be
 * redirected using
 * {@link #redirectOutput(ProcessBuilderForWin32.Redirect) redirectOutput}
 * <li>any redirection set by the
 * {@link #redirectError(ProcessBuilderForWin32.Redirect) redirectError}
 * method is ignored when creating a subprocess
 * <li>the stream returned from {@link Process#getErrorStream()} will
 * always be a <a href="#redirect-output">null input stream</a>
 * </ul>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Modifying a process builder's attributes will affect processes
 * subsequently started by that object's {@link #start()} method, but
 * will never affect previously started processes or the Java process
 * itself.
 *
 * <p>Most error checking is performed by the {@link #start()} method.
 * It is possible to modify the state of an object so that {@link
 * #start()} will fail.  For example, setting the command attribute to
 * an empty list will not throw an exception unless {@link #start()}
 * is invoked.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this class is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a {@code ProcessBuilderForWindows} instance
 * concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies one of the
 * attributes structurally, it <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.
 *
 * <p>Starting a new process which uses the default working directory
 * and environment is easy:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * Process p = new ProcessBuilderForWindows("myCommand", "myArg").start();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working
 * directory and environment, and redirects standard output and error
 * to be appended to a log file:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * ProcessBuilderForWindows pb =
 *   new ProcessBuilderForWindows("myCommand", "myArg1", "myArg2");
 * Map<String, String> env = pb.environment();
 * env.put("VAR1", "myValue");
 * env.remove("OTHERVAR");
 * env.put("VAR2", env.get("VAR1") + "suffix");
 * pb.directory(new File("myDir"));
 * File log = new File("log");
 * pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
 * pb.redirectOutput(Redirect.appendTo(log));
 * Process p = pb.start();
 * assert pb.redirectInput() == Redirect.PIPE;
 * assert pb.redirectOutput().file() == log;
 * assert p.getInputStream().read() == -1;
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To start a process with an explicit set of environment
 * variables, first call {@link Map#clear() Map.clear()}
 * before adding environment variables.
