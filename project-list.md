This page describes details regarding Project screen in Apache DolphinScheduler. Here, you will see all the functions which can be handled in this screen. The following table explains commonly used terms in Apache DolphinScheduler:

Project List
------------

On the project screen, list of all the existing projects along with details like name, owner, workflow definition, process instance, create and update time. This page also facilitates operations like create, edit, and delete project.

### Create Project

The '``Create Project``' button open the following dialog box, where you can enter details like project name, owned user, and project description.

![create-project](/img/new_ui/dev/project/create-project.png)

You can access the newly created project from the project list.

Project Overview
----------------

Project Overview screen shows task status statistics and process status statistics along with the time stamp of project creation. The task status and process status statistics can be observed once the workflow definition is done.

Click the project name link on the project management page to enter the project home page, as shown in the figure below, the project home page contains the task status statistics, process status statistics, and workflow definition statistics of the project. The introduction for those metrics:

*   Task status statistics: within the specified time range, count the number of task instances status as successful submission, running, ready to pause, pause, ready to stop, stop, failure, success, need fault tolerance, kill and waiting threads.
    
*   Process status statistics: within the specified time range, count the number of workflow instances status as submission success, running, ready to pause, pause, ready to stop, stop, failure, success, need fault tolerance, kill and waiting threads.
    
*   Workflow definition statistics: count the workflow definitions created by this user and granted by the administrator.
