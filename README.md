## Features

Apache DolphinScheduler is the modern data workflow orchestration platform with powerful user interface, dedicated to solving complex task dependencies in the data pipeline and providing various types of jobs available `out of the box`

The key features for DolphinScheduler are as follows:
- Easy to deploy, we provide 4 ways to deploy, such as Standalone deployment,Cluster deployment,Docker / Kubernetes deployment and Rainbond deployment
- Easy to use, there are 3 ways to create workflows:
  - Visually, create tasks by dragging and dropping tasks
  - Creating workflows by PyDolphinScheduler(Python way)
  - Creating workflows through Open API

- Highly Reliable,
DolphinScheduler uses a decentralized multi-master and multi-worker architecture, which naturally supports horizontal scaling and high availability
- High performance, its performance is N times faster than other orchestration platform and it can support tens of millions of tasks per day
- Supports multi-tenancy
- Supports various task types: Shell, MR, Spark, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Hive, Spark SQL), Python, Procedure, Sub_Workflow,
Http, K8s, Jupyter, MLflow, SageMaker, DVC, Pytorch, Amazon EMR, etc
- Orchestrating workflows and dependencies, you can pause/stop/recover task any time, failed tasks can be set to automatically retry
- Visualizing the running state of the task in real-time and seeing the task runtime log
- What you see is what you get when you edit the task on the UI
- Backfill can be operated on the UI directly
- Perfect project, resource, data source-level permission control
- Displaying workflow history in tree/Gantt chart, as well as statistical analysis on the task status & process status in each workflow
- Supports internationalization
- Cloud Native, DolphinScheduler supports orchestrating multi-cloud/data center workflow, and 
supports custom task type
- More features waiting for partners to explore

DolphinScheduler is based on a lot of excellent open-source projects, such as Google guava, grpc, netty, quartz, and many open-source projects of Apache and so on.
We would like to express our deep gratitude to all the open-source projects used in DolphinScheduler. We hope that we are not only the beneficiaries of open-source, but also give back to the community. Besides, we hope everyone who have the same enthusiasm and passion for open source could join in and contribute to the open-source community
