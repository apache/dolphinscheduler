## Design Features

DolphinScheduler is a distributed and extensible workflow scheduler platform with powerful DAG visual interfaces, dedicated to solving complex job dependencies in the data pipeline and providing various types of jobs available `out of the box`.

Its main objectives are as follows:

 - Associate the tasks according to the dependencies of the tasks in a DAG graph, which can visualize the running state of the task in real-time.
 - Support various task types: Shell, MR, Spark, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, hive, spark SQL), Python, Sub_Process, Procedure, etc.
 - Support scheduling of workflows and dependencies, manual scheduling to pause/stop/recover task, support failure task retry/alarm, recover specified nodes from failure, kill task, etc.
 - Support the priority of workflows & tasks, task failover, and task timeout alarm or failure.
 - Support workflow global parameters and node customized parameter settings.
 - Support online upload/download/management of resource files, etc. Support online file creation and editing.
 - Support task log online viewing and scrolling and downloading, etc.
 - Have implemented cluster HA, decentralize Master cluster and Worker cluster through Zookeeper.
 - Support the viewing of Master/Worker CPU load, memory, and CPU usage metrics.
 - Support displaying workflow history in tree/Gantt chart, as well as statistical analysis on the task status & process status in each workflow.
 - Support back-filling data.
 - Support multi-tenant.
 - Support internationalization.
 - More features waiting for partners to explore...

## What's in DolphinScheduler

 Stability | Accessibility | Features | Scalability |
 -- | -- | -- | --
Decentralized multi-master and multi-worker | Visualization of workflow key information, such as task status, task type, retry times, task operation machine information, visual variables, and so on at a glance.  |  Support pause, recover operation | Support customized task types
support HA | Visualization of all workflow operations, dragging tasks to draw DAGs, configuring data sources and resources. At the same time, for third-party systems, provide API mode operations. | Users on DolphinScheduler can achieve many-to-one or one-to-one mapping relationship through tenants and Hadoop users, which is very important for scheduling large data jobs.  | The scheduler supports distributed scheduling, and the overall scheduling capability will increase linearly with the scale of the cluster. Master and Worker support dynamic adjustment.
Overload processing: By using the task queue mechanism, the number of schedulable tasks on a single machine can be flexibly configured. Machine jam can be avoided with high tolerance to numbers of tasks cached in task queue. | One-click deployment | Support traditional shell tasks, and big data platform task scheduling: MR, Spark, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, hive, spark SQL), Python, Procedure, Sub_Process |  |

## Thanks

DolphinScheduler is based on a lot of excellent open-source projects, such as Google guava, guice, grpc, netty, ali bonecp, quartz, and many open-source projects of Apache and so on.
We would like to express our deep gratitude to all the open-source projects used in Dolphin Scheduler. We hope that we are not only the beneficiaries of open-source, but also give back to the community. Besides, we hope everyone who have the same enthusiasm and passion for open source could join in and contribute to the open-source community!
