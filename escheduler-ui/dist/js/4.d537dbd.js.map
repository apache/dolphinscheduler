These functions work with Bezier\n * curves of arbitrary degree.\n *\n * - functions are all in the 'jsBezier' namespace.\n *\n * - all input points should be in the format {x:.., y:..}. all output points are in this format too.\n *\n * - all input curves should be in the format [ {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..} ]\n *\n * - 'location' as used as an input here refers to a decimal in the range 0-1 inclusive, which indicates a point some proportion along the length\n * of the curve.  location as output has the same format and meaning.\n *\n *\n * Function List:\n * --------------\n *\n * distanceFromCurve(point, curve)\n *\n * \tCalculates the distance that the given point lies from the given Bezier.  Note that it is computed relative to the center of the Bezier,\n * so if you have stroked the curve with a wide pen you may wish to take that into account!  The distance returned is relative to the values\n * of the curve and the point - it will most likely be pixels.\n *\n * gradientAtPoint(curve, location)\n *\n * \tCalculates the gradient to the curve at the given location, as a decimal between 0 and 1 inclusive.\n *\n * gradientAtPointAlongCurveFrom (curve, location)\n *\n *\tCalculates the gradient at the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.\n *\n * nearestPointOnCurve(point, curve)\n *\n *\tCalculates the nearest point to the given point on the given curve.  The return value of this is a JS object literal, containing both the\n *point's coordinates and also the 'location' of the point (see above), for example:  { point:{x:551,y:150}, location:0.263365 }.\n *\n * pointOnCurve(curve, location)\n *\n * \tCalculates the coordinates of the point on the given Bezier curve at the given location.\n *\n * pointAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)\n *\n * \tCalculates the coordinates of the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate\n * space as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.\n *\n * locationAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)\n *\n * \tCalculates the location on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate\n * space as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.\n *\n * perpendicularToCurveAt(curve, location, length, distance)\n *\n * \tCalculates the perpendicular to the given curve at the given location.  length is the length of the line you wish for (it will be centered\n * on the point at 'location'). distance is optional, and allows you to specify a point along the path from the given location as the center of\n * the perpendicular returned.  The return value of this is an array of two points: [ {x:...,y:...}, {x:...,y:...} ].\n *\n *\n */\n\n(function() {\n\n    var root = this;\n\n    if(typeof Math.sgn == \"undefined\") {\n        Math.sgn = function(x) { return x == 0 ? 0 : x > 0 ? 1 :-1; };\n    }\n\n    var Vectors = {\n            subtract \t: \tfunction(v1, v2) { return {x:v1.x - v2.x, y:v1.y - v2.y }; },\n            dotProduct\t: \tfunction(v1, v2) { return (v1.x * v2.x)  + (v1.y * v2.y); },\n            square\t\t:\tfunction(v) { return Math.sqrt((v.x * v.x) + (v.y * v.y)); },\n            scale\t\t:\tfunction(v, s) { return {x:v.x * s, y:v.y * s }; }\n        },\n\n        maxRecursion = 64,\n        flatnessTolerance = Math.pow(2.0,-maxRecursion-1);\n\n    /**\n     * Calculates the distance that the point lies from the curve.\n     *\n     * @param point a point in the form {x:567, y:3342}\n     * @param curve a Bezier curve in the form [{x:..., y:...}, {x:..., y:...}, {x:..., y:...}, {x:..., y:...}].  note that this is currently\n     * hardcoded to assume cubiz beziers, but would be better off supporting any degree.\n     * @return a JS object literal containing location and distance, for example: {location:0.35, distance:10}.
