**PyDolphinScheduler** is python API for Apache DolphinScheduler, which allow you definition
your workflow by python code, aka workflow-as-codes.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```shell
# Install
$ pip install apache-dolphinscheduler

# Verify installation is successful, it will show the version of apache-dolphinscheduler, here we use 0.1.0 as example
$ pydolphinscheduler version
0.1.0
```

Here we show you how to install and run a simple example of pydolphinscheduler

### Start Server And Run Example

Before you run an example, you have to start backend server. You could follow
[development setup](https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/en-us/development/development-environment-setup.html)
section "DolphinScheduler Standalone Quick Start" to set up developer environment. You have to start backend
and frontend server in this step, which mean that you could view DolphinScheduler UI in your browser with URL
http://localhost:12345/dolphinscheduler

After backend server is being start, all requests from `pydolphinscheduler` would be sent to backend server.
And for now we could run a simple example by:

<!-- TODO Add examples directory to dist package later. -->

```shell
# Please make sure your terminal could 
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/dev/dolphinscheduler-python/pydolphinscheduler/examples/tutorial.py -o ./tutorial.py
python ./tutorial.py
```

> **_NOTICE:_** Since Apache DolphinScheduler's tenant is requests while running command, you might need to change
> tenant value in `example/tutorial.py`. For now the value is `tenant_exists`, please change it to username exists
> in you environment. 

After command execute, you could see a new project with single process definition named *tutorial* in the
[UI-project list](https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/en-us/docs/latest/user_doc/guide/project/project-list.html). 

## Develop
