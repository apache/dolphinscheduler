Submit Your Code from Different machine
=======================================

Generally, we use pydolphinscheduler as a client to DolphinScheduler, and consider we may change our workflow
code frequently, the best practice is running :ref:`python gateway service <start:start python gateway service>`
in your server machine and submit the workflow code from your development machine, like a laptop or PC. This behavior
is supported by pydolphinscheduler out of box with one or two single command lines. 

Export Configuration File
-------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pydolphinscheduler config --init

your could find more detail in :ref:`configuration exporting <config:export configuration file>`

Run API Server in Other Host
----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pydolphinscheduler config --set java_gateway.address <your-api-server-ip-or-hostname>

your could find more detail in :ref:`configuration setting <config:change configuration>`

Run API Server in Other Port
----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pydolphinscheduler config --set java_gateway.port <your-python-gateway-service-port>

your could find more detail in :ref:`configuration setting <config:change configuration>`
