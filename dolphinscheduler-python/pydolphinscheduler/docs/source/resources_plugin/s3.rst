S3
==

`S3` is a Amazon S3 resource plugin for pydolphinscheduler.

When using a Amazon S3 resource plugin, you only need to add the `resource_plugin` parameter in the task subclass or workflow definition,
such as `resource_plugin=S3(prefix="xxx")`, if the file is publicly readable.

When the file is private, using `resource_plugin=S3(prefix="xxx", access_key_id="xxx", access_key_secret="xxx")`

You can view this `document <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html>`_
when creating a pair `AccessKey`.

For the specific use of resource plugins, you can see `How to use` in :doc:`resource-plugin`
