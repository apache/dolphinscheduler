###### IssueLink Adder #################################################################################################
# Insert Issue (Jira/Github etc) link in PR description based on the Issue ID in PR title.
insertIssueLinkInPrDescription:
  # specify the placeholder for the issue link that should be present in the description
  descriptionIssuePlaceholderRegexp: "^fix: (.*)$"
  matchers:
    # you can have several matches - for different types of issues
    # only the first matching entry is replaced
    jiraIssueMatch:
      # specify the regexp of issue id that you can find in the title of the PR
      # the match groups can be used to build the issue id (${1}, ${2}, etc.).
      titleIssueIdRegexp: \[(Feature|Fix|Improvement|Test|E2E|Doc-[0-9]+)\]
      # the issue link to be added. ${1}, ${2} ... are replaced with the match groups from the
      # title match (remember to use quotes)
      descriptionIssueLink: "[${1}](https://github.com/apache/dolphinschedule/${1}/)"

###### Title Validator #################################################################################################
# Verifies if commit/PR titles match the regexp specified
verifyTitles:
  # Regular expression that should be matched by titles of commits or PR
  titleRegexp: ^\[DSIP-[0-9]+\].*$|^\[Feature-[0-9]+\].*$|^\[Fix-[0-9]+\].*$|^\[Doc-[0-9]+\].*$|^\[Improvement-[0-9]+\].*$|^\[Test-[0-9]+\].*$|^\[E2E-[0-9]+\].*$|^\[CI].*$|^\[Chore].*$
  # If set to true, it will always check the PR title (as opposed to the individual commits).
  alwaysUsePrTitle: true
  # If set to true, it will only check the commit in case there is a single commit.
  # In case of multiple commits it will check PR title.
  # This reflects the standard behaviour of Github that for `Squash & Merge` GitHub
  # uses the PR title rather than commit messages for the squashed commit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  # For single-commit PRs it takes the squashed commit message from the commit as expected.
  #
  # If set to false it will check all commit messages. This is useful when you do not squash commits at merge.
  validateEitherPrOrSingleCommitTitle: true
  # The title the GitHub status should appear from.
  statusTitle: "Title Validator"
  # A custom message to be displayed when the title passes validation.
  successMessage: "Title Validation successful!"
  # A custom message to be displayed when the title fails validation.
  # Allows insertion of ${type} (commit/PR), ${title} (the title validated) and ${regex} (the titleRegexp above).
  failureMessage: "Wrong ${type} title: ${title}"

# Various Flags to control behaviour of the "Labeler"
labelerFlags:
  # If this flag is changed to 'false', labels would only be added when the PR is first created
  # and not when existing PR is updated.
  # The default is 'true' which means the labels would be added when PR is updated even if they
  # were removed by the user
  labelOnPRUpdates: true
