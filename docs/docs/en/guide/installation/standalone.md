# Standalone

Standalone only for quick experience for DolphinScheduler.

If you are a new hand and want to experience DolphinScheduler functions, we recommend you install follow [Standalone deployment](standalone.md). If you want to experience more complete functions and schedule massive tasks, we recommend you install follow [pseudo-cluster deployment](pseudo-cluster.md). If you want to deploy DolphinScheduler in production, we recommend you follow [cluster deployment](cluster.md) or [Kubernetes deployment](kubernetes.md).

> **_Note:_** Standalone only recommends the usage of fewer than 20 workflows, because it uses H2 Database, ZooKeeper Testing Server, too many tasks may cause instability.

## Preparation

* JDKï¼šdownload [JDK][jdk] (1.8+), and configure `JAVA_HOME` to and `PATH` variable. You can skip this step if it already exists in your environment.
* Binary package: download the DolphinScheduler binary package at [download page](https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/en-us/download/download.html).
