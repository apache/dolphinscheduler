# Standalone

Standalone only for quick experience for DolphinScheduler.

If you are a new hand and want to experience DolphinScheduler functions, we recommend you install follow Standalone deployment. If you want to experience more complete functions and schedule massive tasks, we recommend you install follow [pseudo-cluster deployment](pseudo-cluster.md). If you want to deploy DolphinScheduler in production, we recommend you follow [cluster deployment](cluster.md) or [Kubernetes deployment](kubernetes.md).

> **_Note:_** Standalone only recommends the usage of fewer than 20 workflows, because it uses in-memory H2 Database in default, ZooKeeper Testing Server, too many tasks may cause instability.
> When Standalone stops or restarts, in-memory H2 database will clear up. To use Standalone with external databases like mysql or postgresql, please see [`Database Configuration`](#database-configuration).    

## Preparation

* JDKï¼šdownload [JDK][jdk] (1.8+), and configure `JAVA_HOME` to and `PATH` variable. You can skip this step if it already exists in your environment.
* Binary package: download the DolphinScheduler binary package at [download page](https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/en-us/download/download.html).

## Start DolphinScheduler Standalone Server

### Extract and Start DolphinScheduler

There is a standalone startup script in the binary compressed package, which can be quickly started after extraction. Switch to a user with sudo permission and run the script:

```shell
# Extract and start Standalone Server
tar -xvzf apache-dolphinscheduler-*-bin.tar.gz
cd apache-dolphinscheduler-*-bin
sh ./bin/dolphinscheduler-daemon.sh start standalone-server
```

### Login DolphinScheduler

Access address `http://localhost:12345/dolphinscheduler/ui` and login DolphinScheduler UI. The default username and password are **admin/dolphinscheduler123**

### Start or Stop Server

The script `./bin/dolphinscheduler-daemon.sh`can be used not only quickly start standalone, but also to stop the service operation. The following are all the commands:

```shell
# Start Standalone Server
sh ./bin/dolphinscheduler-daemon.sh start standalone-server
# Stop Standalone Server
sh ./bin/dolphinscheduler-daemon.sh stop standalone-server
```

> Note: Python gateway service is started along with the api-server, and if you do not want to start Python gateway
> service please disabled it by changing the yaml config `python-gateway.enabled : false` in api-server's configuration
> path `api-server/conf/application.yaml`

## Database Configuration

Standalone server use H2 database as its metadata store, it is easy and users do not need to start database before they set up server.
But if user want to store metabase in other database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, they have to change some configuration. And we here use
MySQL as an example to illustrate how to configure an external database:

* First of all, follow the instructions in [pseudo-cluster deployment](pseudo-cluster.md) `Initialize the Database` section to create and initialize database
* Set the following environment variables in your terminal with your database username and password for `{user}` and `{password}`:

```shell
export DATABASE=${DATABASE:-mysql}
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=${DATABASE}
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME={user}
export SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD={password}
```

* Add mysql-connector-java driver to `./standalone-server/libs/standalone-server/`, see [pseudo-cluster deployment](pseudo-cluster.md) `Initialize the Database` section about where to download
* Start standalone-server, now you are using mysql as database and it will not clear up your data when you stop or restart standalone-server.
