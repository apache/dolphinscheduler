# SubProcess Node

## Overview

The sub-process node is to execute an external workflow definition as a task node.

## Create Task

- Click `Project -> Management-Project -> Name-Workflow Definition`, and click the `Create Workflow` button to enter the DAG editing page.
- Drag from the toolbar <img src="/img/tasks/icons/sub_process.png" width="15"/> task node to canvas to create a new SubProcess task.

## Task Parameter

- Node name: The node name in a workflow definition is unique.
- Run flag: Identifies whether this node schedules normally.
- Descriptive information: Describe the function of the node.
- Task priority: When the number of worker threads is insufficient, execute in the order of priority from high to low, and tasks with the same priority will execute in a first-in first-out order.
- Worker grouping: Assign tasks to the machines of the worker group to execute. If `Default` is selected, randomly select a worker machine for execution.
- Environment Name: Configure the environment name in which run the script.
- Timeout alarm: Check the timeout alarm and timeout failure. When the task runs exceed the "timeout", an alarm email will send and the task execution will fail.
- Sub-node: It is the workflow definition of the selected sub-process. Enter the sub-node in the upper right corner to jump to the workflow definition of the selected sub-process.
- Predecessor task: Selecting a predecessor task for the current task, will set the selected predecessor task as upstream of the current task.

## Task Example

This example simulates a common task type, here we use a child node task to recall the [Shell](shell.md) to print out "hello". This means executing a shell task as a child node.

### Create a Shell task

Create a shell task to print "hello" and define the workflow as `test_dag01`.

## Create the Sub_process task

To use the sub_process, you need to create the sub-node task, which is the shell task we created in the first step. After that, as shown in the diagram below, select the corresponding sub-node in position â‘¤.

After creating the sub_process, create a corresponding shell task for printing "world" and link both together. Save the current workflow and run it to get the expected result.

## Notice

When using `sub_process` to recall a sub-node task, you need to ensure that the defined sub-node is online status, otherwise, the sub_process workflow will not work properly.
