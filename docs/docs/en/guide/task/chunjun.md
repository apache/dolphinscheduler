# ChunJun

## Overview

ChunJun task type for executing ChunJun programs. For ChunJun nodes, the worker will execute `${CHUNJUN_HOME}/bin/start-chunjun` to analyze the input json file.

## Create Task

- Click `Project Management -> Project Name -> Workflow Definition`, and click the `Create Workflow` button to enter the DAG editing page.
- Drag the <img src="../../../../img/tasks/icons/chunjun.png" width="15"/> from the toolbar to the drawing board.

## Task Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Node name | The node name in a workflow definition is unique. |
| Run flag | Identifies whether this node schedules normally, if it does not need to execute, select the prohibition execution. |
| Task priority | When the number of worker threads is insufficient, execute in the order of priority from high to low, and tasks with the same priority will execute in a first-in first-out order. |
| Description | Describe the function of the node. |
| Worker group | Assign tasks to the machines of the worker group to execute. If `Default` is selected, randomly select a worker machine for execution. |
| Environment Name | Configure the environment name in which run the script. |
| Number of failed retries | The number of times the task failed to resubmit. |
| Failed retry interval | The time interval (unit minute) for resubmitting the task after a failed task. |
| Task group name | The task group name. |
| Priority | The task priority. |
| Delayed execution time |  The time, in cents, that a task is delayed in execution. |
| Timeout alarm | Check the timeout alarm and timeout failure. When the task exceeds the "timeout period", an alarm email will be sent and the task execution will fail. |
| Custom template | Custom the content of the ChunJun node's json profile. |
| json | json configuration file for ChunJun synchronization. |
| Custom parameters | SQL task type, and stored procedure is a custom parameter order to set values for the method. The custom parameter type and data type are the same as the stored procedure task type. The difference is that the SQL task type custom parameter will replace the \${variable} in the SQL statement. |
| Deploy mode | Execute chunjun task mode, eg local standalone. |
| Option Parameters | Support such as `-confProp "{\"flink.checkpoint.interval\":60000}"` |
| Predecessor task | Selecting a predecessor task for the current task will set the selected predecessor task as upstream of the current task. |

## Task Example

This example demonstrates importing data from Hive into MySQL.

### Configuring the ChunJun environment in DolphinScheduler

If you are using the ChunJun task type in a production environment, it is necessary to configure the required environment first. The configuration file is as follows: `/dolphinscheduler/conf/env/dolphinscheduler_env.sh`.

![chunjun_task01](../../../../img/tasks/demo/chunjun_task01.png)

After the environment has been configured, DolphinScheduler needs to be restarted.

### Configuring ChunJun Task Node

As the data to be read from Hive, a custom json is required, refer to: [Hive Json Template](https://github.com/DTStack/chunjun/blob/master/chunjun-examples/json/hive/binlog_hive.json).

After writing the required json file, you can configure the node content by following the steps in the diagram below.

### Note

Before execute ${CHUNJUN_HOME}/bin/start-chunjun, need to change the shell ${CHUNJUN_HOME}/bin/start-chunjun, remove '&' in order to run in front. 

 such as:

```shell
nohup $JAVA_RUN -cp $JAR_DIR $CLASS_NAME $@ &
```

update to following:

```shell
nohup $JAVA_RUN -cp $JAR_DIR $CLASS_NAME $@
```
