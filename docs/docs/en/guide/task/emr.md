# Amazon EMR

## Overview

Amazon EMR task type, for operation EMR clusters on AWS and running computing tasks. 
Using [aws-java-sdk](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/sdk-for-java/) in the background code, to transfer JSON parameters to task object and submit to AWS, Two program types are currently supported:

* `RUN_JOB_FLOW` Using [API_RunJobFlow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_RunJobFlow.html#API_RunJobFlow_Examples) submit [RunJobFlowRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/elasticmapreduce/model/RunJobFlowRequest.html) object
* `ADD_JOB_FLOW_STEPS` Using [API_AddJobFlowSteps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_AddJobFlowSteps.html#API_AddJobFlowSteps_Examples) submit [AddJobFlowStepsRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/elasticmapreduce/model/AddJobFlowStepsRequest.html) object

## Parameter

- Node name: The node name in a workflow definition is unique.
- Run flag: Identifies whether this node schedules normally, if it does not need to execute, select the `prohibition execution`.
- Descriptive information: Describe the function of the node.
- Task priority: When the number of worker threads is insufficient, execute in the order of priority from high to low, and tasks with the same priority will execute in a first-in first-out order.
- Worker grouping: Assign tasks to the machines of the worker group to execute. If `Default` is selected, randomly select a worker machine for execution.
- Times of failed retry attempts: The number of times the task failed to resubmit. You can select from drop-down or fill-in a number.
- Failed retry interval: The time interval for resubmitting the task after a failed task. You can select from drop-down or fill-in a number.
- Timeout alarm: Check the timeout alarm and timeout failure. When the task runs exceed the "timeout", an alarm email will send and the task execution will fail.
- Program Type: Select the program type. If it is `RUN_JOB_FLOW`, you need to fill in `jobFlowDefineJson`, if it is `ADD_JOB_FLOW_STEPS`, you need to fill in `stepsDefineJson`。
- jobFlowDefineJson: JSON corresponding to the [RunJobFlowRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/elasticmapreduce/model/RunJobFlowRequest.html) object, for details refer to [API_RunJobFlow_Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_RunJobFlow.html#API_RunJobFlow_Examples).
- stepsDefineJson：JSON corresponding to the [AddJobFlowStepsRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/elasticmapreduce/model/AddJobFlowStepsRequest.html) object, for details refer to [API_AddJobFlowSteps_Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_AddJobFlowSteps.html#API_AddJobFlowSteps_Examples).

## stepsDefineJson example
```json

  "JobFlowId": "j-3V628TKAERHP8",
  "Steps": [
    {
      "Name": "calculate_pi",
      "ActionOnFailure": "CONTINUE",
      "HadoopJarStep": {
        "Jar": "command-runner.jar",
        "Args": [
          "/usr/lib/spark/bin/run-example",
          "SparkPi",
          "15"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notice

- Failover on EMR Task type has not been implemented. In this time, DS only supports failover on yarn task type . Other task type, such as EMR task, k8s task not ready yet.
- `stepsDefineJson` A task definition only supports the association of a single step, which can better ensure the reliability of the task state.
