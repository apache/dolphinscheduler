Using MySQL as an example, change the value if you use other databases. Please manually download the [mysql-connector-java driver jar](https://downloads.MySQL.com/archives/c-j/)
jar package and add it to the `./tools/libs` directory, then change `./bin/ env/dolphinscheduler_env.sh` file

    ```shell

## Notice

### Differences of worker group (before or after version 1.3.1 of dolphinscheduler)

The architecture of worker group is different between version before version 1.3.1 until version 2.0.0

- Before version 1.3.1(include itself) worker group can be created through UI interface.
- Since version 1.3.1 and before version 2.0.0, worker group can be created by modifying the worker configuration. 

#### How Can I Do When I Upgrade from 1.3.1 to version before 2.0.0

* Check the backup database, search records in table `t_ds_worker_group` table and mainly focus on three columns: `id, name and IP`.

| id | name | ip_list    |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| 1   | service1     | 192.168.xx.10    |
| 2   | service2     | 192.168.xx.11,192.168.xx.12      |

* Modify worker related configuration in `bin/env/install_config.conf`.

Assume bellow are the machine worker service to be deployed:

| hostname | ip |
| :---  | :---:  |
| ds1   | 192.168.xx.10     |
| ds2   | 192.168.xx.11     |
| ds3   | 192.168.xx.12     |

To keep worker group config consistent with the previous version, we need to modify workers configuration as below:

```shell
#worker service is deployed on which machine, and also specify which worker group this worker belongs to. 
workers="ds1:service1,ds2:service2,ds3:service2"
```

#### The Worker Group has Been Enhanced in Version 1.3.2

Workers in 1.3.1 can only belong to one worker group, but after version 1.3.2 and before version 2.0.0 worker support more than one worker group. 

```sh
workers="ds1:service1,ds1:service2"
```

#### Recovery UI Create Worker Group after Version 2.0.0

After version 2.0.0, include itself, we are recovery function create worker group from web UI.
