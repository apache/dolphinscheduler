# Configuration

The Resource Center is usually used for operations such as uploading files, UDF functions, and task group management. You can appoint the local file directory as the upload directory for a single machine (this operation does not need to deploy Hadoop). Or you can also upload to a Hadoop or MinIO cluster, at this time, you need to have Hadoop (2.6+) or MinIO or other related environments.

## Local File Resource Configuration

For a single machine, you can choose to use local file directory as the upload directory (no need to deploy Hadoop) by making the following configuration.

### Configuring the `common.properties`

Configure the file in the following paths: `api-server/conf/common.properties` and `worker-server/conf/common.properties`.

- Change `data.basedir.path` to the local directory path. Please make sure the user who deploy dolphinscheduler have read and write permissions, such as: `data.basedir.path=/tmp/dolphinscheduler`. And the directory you configured will be auto-created if it does not exists.
- Modify the following two parameters, `resource.storage.type=HDFS` and `fs.defaultFS=file:///`.

## HDFS Resource Configuration

When it is necessary to use the Resource Center to create or upload relevant files, all files and resources will be stored on HDFS. Therefore the following configuration is required.

### Configuring the common.properties

After version 3.0.0-alpha, if you want to upload resources using HDFS or S3 from the Resource Center, the following paths need to be configured: `api-server/conf/common.properties` and `worker-server/conf/common.properties`. This can be found as follows.

> **_Note:_**
>
> *  If only the `api-server/conf/common.properties` file is configured, then resource uploading is enabled, but you can not use resources in task. If you want to use or execute the files in the workflow you need to configure `worker-server/conf/common.properties` too.
> * If you want to use the resource upload function, the deployment user in [installation and deployment](../installation/standalone.md) must have relevant operation authority.
> * If you using a Hadoop cluster with HA, you need to enable HDFS resource upload, and you need to copy the `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml` under the Hadoop cluster to `/opt/dolphinscheduler/conf`, otherwise skip this copy step.
