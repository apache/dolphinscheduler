## Example

The example uses a simple shell script to demonstrate the use of resource center files in workflow definitions. The same is true for tasks such as MR and Spark, which require jar packages.

### Create a shell file

Create a shell file, print `hello world`.

Create the workflow execution shell

In the workflow definition module of project Manage, create a new workflow using a shell task.

- Script: 'sh hello.sh'
- Resource: Select 'hello.sh'

### View the results

You can view the log results of running the node in the workflow example. The diagram below:
