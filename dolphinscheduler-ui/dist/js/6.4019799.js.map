How Properties of Mime Types are used by SQL Mode\n  =================================================\n\n  keywords:\n    A list of keywords you want to be highlighted.\n  builtin:\n    A list of builtin types you want to be highlighted (if you want types to be of class \"builtin\" instead of \"keyword\").\n  operatorChars:\n    All characters that must be handled as operators.\n  client:\n    Commands parsed and executed by the client (not the server).\n  support:\n    A list of supported syntaxes which are not common, but are supported by more than 1 DBMS.\n    * ODBCdotTable: .tableName\n    * zerolessFloat: .1\n    * doubleQuote\n    * nCharCast: N'string'\n    * charsetCast: _utf8'string'\n    * commentHash: use # char for comments\n    * commentSlashSlash: use // for comments\n    * commentSpaceRequired: require a space after -- for comments\n  atoms:\n    Keywords that must be highlighted as atoms,. Some DBMS's support more atoms than others:\n    UNKNOWN, INFINITY, UNDERFLOW, NaN...\n  dateSQL:\n    Used for date/time SQL standard syntax, because not all DBMS's support same temporal types.\n*/\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/codemirror/mode/sql/sql.js\n// module id = 901\n// module chunks = 6 18 19 23 24 26","/*\n * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n * contributor license agreements.

These functions work with Bezier\n * curves of arbitrary degree.\n *\n * - functions are all in the 'jsBezier' namespace.\n *\n * - all input points should be in the format {x:.., y:..}. all output points are in this format too.\n *\n * - all input curves should be in the format [ {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..} ]\n *\n * - 'location' as used as an input here refers to a decimal in the range 0-1 inclusive, which indicates a point some proportion along the length\n * of the curve.  location as output has the same format and meaning.\n *\n *\n * Function List:\n * --------------\n *\n * distanceFromCurve(point, curve)\n *\n * \tCalculates the distance that the given point lies from the given Bezier.  Note that it is computed relative to the center of the Bezier,\n * so if you have stroked the curve with a wide pen you may wish to take that into account!  The distance returned is relative to the values\n * of the curve and the point - it will most likely be pixels.\n *\n * gradientAtPoint(curve, location)\n *\n * \tCalculates the gradient to the curve at the given location, as a decimal between 0 and 1 inclusive.\n *\n * gradientAtPointAlongCurveFrom (curve, location)\n *\n *\tCalculates the gradient at the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.\n *\n * nearestPointOnCurve(point, curve)\n *\n *\tCalculates the nearest point to the given point on the given curve.  The return value of this is a JS object literal, containing both the\n *point's coordinates and also the 'location' of the point (see above), for example:  { point:{x:551,y:150}, location:0.263365 }.\n *\n * pointOnCurve(curve, location)\n *\n * \tCalculates the coordinates of the point on the given Bezier curve at the given location.\n *\n * pointAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)\n *\n * \tCalculates the coordinates of the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate\n * space as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.\n *\n * locationAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)\n *\n * \tCalculates the location on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate\n * space as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.\n *\n * perpendicularToCurveAt(curve, location, length, distance)\n *\n * \tCalculates the perpendicular to the given curve at the given location.  length is the length of the line you wish for (it will be centered\n * on the point at 'location'). distance is optional, and allows you to specify a point along the path from the given location as the center of\n * the perpendicular returned.
